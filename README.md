# DevFlow Example — Quiz Bank

> A reference implementation demonstrating how DevFlow structures AI-assisted software development through a real project.

This repository is the official reference implementation of **DevFlow**.

Rather than explaining the workflow through abstract concepts, this project demonstrates how DevFlow artifacts evolve while building a complete Quiz Bank application—from the initial idea to a working product.

Every development decision is preserved as part of the project itself, allowing both humans and AI to continue development across sessions without relying on conversation history.

# Purpose

This repository demonstrates how DevFlow organizes software development into persistent project artifacts.

Instead of treating AI conversations as project memory, DevFlow stores project state directly inside the repository.

By following this example, you can see:

* How a project starts from an initial intent.
* How requirements are clarified through interviews.
* How objectives become executable tasks.
* How execution progress is tracked.
* How project context remains independent from conversations.
* How development decisions are preserved as evidence.

# What This Repository Demonstrates

This project builds a simple Quiz Bank application.

The application itself is intentionally small.

The primary purpose is to demonstrate the DevFlow workflow rather than application complexity.

Current development roadmap:

* V1 — Question Bank
* V2 — Quiz Builder
* V3 — Online Exam

Each version introduces additional DevFlow artifacts while keeping the application understandable.

# Development Philosophy

DevFlow separates **project state** from **AI conversations**.

Instead of depending on a chat history, every important decision is externalized into structured Markdown artifacts.

This allows development to continue across:

* new AI sessions
* different AI models
* different engineers
* different development tools

without reconstructing project context from scratch.

# Learning Path

The recommended reading order is:

1. Intent
2. Interview
3. Objective
4. Task
5. Status
6. Context
7. Evidence

Following this order shows how an idea gradually becomes executable software.

# Relationship to DevFlow

This repository is a reference implementation.

The DevFlow framework itself is maintained separately.

**DevFlow Framework**

https://github.com/NextEvoEco/devflow

This repository focuses on demonstrating how DevFlow is applied in practice.
